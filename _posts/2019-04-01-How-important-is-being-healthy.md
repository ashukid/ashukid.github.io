3 MONTHS has past this year and it seems I spent all 3 recovering from different health issues. 

First I got attacked with eye pain in January, and I had to limit laptop uses, which was a big challenge for me as most of time of my daily routine spends on laptop. 

Then with throat infection and complete bedrest for almost a week in february. Then for a week everything was fine, but then again eye pain started.

This time it was more sever and instead of limiting laptop used I had to stop using it altogether. For almost 3 weeks in March I didn't use laptop. Then it was time for mid-semester break and I went to my home in the hope of 1 week complete break from any screens. 

Till the end of week my plan was working fine, then suddenly I got attacked from all side - flu, cold, cough, chest pain, eye infection, throat infection and what not. I had to extend my vacation for almost a week in the hope of recovery.

Last saturday I came back to hostel and I was almost recoverd from everything. 2 days went quite well, but again today I'm feeling chest pain and it's around 1:00AM so can't do anything other than pondering what have I lost in last 3 months because of my health issues.

There is also postitive side of all this. Because of eye pain I learnt how to spend my day without using laptop. Because of other health issues I got to spend a lot time with my family. So yes it was fun, but then again I got what I didn't expect, and still couldn't get what I planned for this year. 

Anyway there is nothing and no-one to complain for.
