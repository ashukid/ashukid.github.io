title:  "Finished Coding Backpropagation from scrach"

Today I finished coding backpropagation from scratch using only numpy and matplotlib. I already tried doing this 3-4 times before, but couldn't finish, maybe my understanding was not clear before.

The best part is I didn't have to decode my code even once, which is very unusual for me, because I usually makes so many mistakes. 

I'm going to experiment with this for a while and write a blog very soon on this topic.
