The book was written in 1950s with a vision of what might happen in 1980s. It didn't happen, but once we go through the book, we feel it's `relevancy to the upcoming future more than ever`. The combined `biotech` and `infotech` movement that we're witnessing now might result in a future envisioned by George Orwell and atleast I'm very much convinced it's gonna happen. So have a seat and look into humanities most probable future.

We humans believe one of the stronged part of homo sapiens is `emotion`. We have intuition about right and wrong, we trust each others, we love each others and there is no limitations to these feelings. But there is, and that's the point to contemplate. While going through the story, all the time you wait for that heroic humanistic emotional comeback, but there isn't and sadly that's the truth.
