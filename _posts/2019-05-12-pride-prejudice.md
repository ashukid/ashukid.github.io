title: "Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen"
excerpt: Pride is what we should own, but we don't and we hate it in others, prejudice is what we shouldn't, but we do and we aren't aware of it. This book is a classic tale radically outlining the effect of both.

`Pride` in general sense is seen as a negative emotion and the person possessing it is villified. But pride is neither what we define it to be and nor the person possessing it is actually the person we portray. This book rightly protrays what we think about `prideful` peroson and what actually they are.

`Prejudice` is what we least care for, but defines our decision making and understanding. This book shows how easily we're `Prejudiced` and we don't even know and how catastrophe the effect can be.

Along with the central theme, the book also fosters 2 love stories, very different from each other - one was destined from the very start, still faces so many hindrances and obstacles, another one was never exepcted, but nurtures as the story goes on coping with all the barriers.

At the end it's all about `pride` and `prejudcie`.
