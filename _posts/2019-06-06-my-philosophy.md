title: "Philosophy of 22 years old kid"
excerpt: I had read many books and observed people, society and thought about this for a very long time. I'm aged 22 and I think I should write down what I think about all this, so that in future I can look back and say - hey how wrong I was!

### == Who we are ==

I'm inspired from Richard Dawking and Charles Darwin `evolution` theory and believe we all are just the the advance organism evovled from very rudementary cells. We evolved on our own, there is no heavenly objective in this, just natural selection. That simplies things a lot.

### == What is our purpose of life ==

There is no godly or `true purpose` of one's life. As a part of humanity we might say our purpose is to reproduce and push the development of our species forward, but that applies to all living species.<br>
But since only humans are conscious of their present and upcoming future, we need some purpose to follow, and that comes from circumstances we live in. Like a person living in slum might have the purpose to have good flat in city. But these purposes are purely `synthetic` and we're free to have any one of them.

### == Is there any god ==

I haven't seen and never felt need of one. I think at the very start some smart people figured out most of the humans are `weak` and have low `self confidence`. So they thought of ruling all of them, without making themselves as central figure. And that's why they created religion.

### == Root Problem ==

I don't think our root problem is lack of education or healthcare services. Our central problem is `we` ourselves. We've build this world so whatever happens, we're only responsible.
