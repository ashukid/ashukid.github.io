“Travelling as a broke college student”, the idea may not be new to friends living overseas, but for someone raised in an Indian middle-class family, it can feel uncanny.

When I told my parents, as a 20-year-old not nearly fresh out of college, that I wanted to roam the streets of India, volunteer at hostels, and meet new people, they only had one thing to say: “but what for?”. Concern for safety aside, the idea of wandering aimlessly, even for a little while, does not sit well with brown parents. But my mind was made up. As I packed my bags and left behind the comfort of home and two upset parents, I was a ball of nerves—and excited.

If, like me, travelling the world is calling out to you but you don’t know where to begin, make this guide your best friend.


## Why travel solo?

If you are new to the world of travel, going off on a solo adventure can be intimidating. Planning, logistics, and life’s plain unpredictability can definitely use some company. On the other hand, going solo may open up many otherwise-missed opportunities.

When you travel alone, you live on your own schedule. Making impromptu plans is easier when you don’t have to account for another person. With this flexibility you can make better use of your resources, especially on a budget. Skip the fancy stay and put your money toward trying out an adventure sport or exploring the local cuisine instead.

Aside from the place itself, it’s the people that add the most colour to any trip. Travelling alone gives you a chance to mingle with new people, hear their stories, and sometimes even make friendships that last a lifetime. All this and more can make travelling solo worth your while.

## What could go wrong?

It’s easy to get enchanted by the idea of being a nomad. But it’s not without its challenges. Be prepared.

### Money matters

My new-found freedom came with a very empty pocket. Money can’t buy happiness, but it does buy the essentials (and some much-needed comforts) during travel. Plan your spend on food and transport, but also set aside funds for fun activities and emergencies.

### Meeting new people

Even solo travellers need company. Introducing yourself can be daunting, especially if everyone already seems paired off. My mantra: “what’s there to lose?”. The worst they can say is no. Put yourself out there, offer snacks, or chime into the discussion—you might make a new friend.

### Unforeseen roadblocks

Missed a bus, lost a bag, or started feeling sick? It can feel like a disaster, but a backup plan, an emergency contact, and travel insurance go a long way. You can’t plan for everything, so stay calm and keep moving.

### Safety

Safety is the number one concern for solo travellers, especially women. Pick the right stay, share your whereabouts with someone, and travel in groups for hikes or treks. It can literally be a life saver.

## How to work around it

Preparedness makes the difference. Here are simple ways to stay ahead of the odds and still have fun.


### Planning and spontaneity

Good travel is an equal mix of planning and flexibility. Once you pick a destination, plan your itinerary. Access to medical facilities and good connectivity matter if you are staying longer. I like to look up cafes and hangs—they become regular haunts for travellers and are perfect places to find company.

### Research the locality

Accustom yourself to local customs and traditions. Some countries dress more modestly. Knowing how to dress, eat, and behave so you don’t come off as rude (or get into trouble) makes your stay more pleasant.

### Getting the best deals

Extra cash always helps on the road. Book stays and flights 2–3 months in advance for better prices, especially in peak season. Turn on price alerts. If your schedule is flexible, travel off-season. Use comparison sites like Google Flights, Kayak, or Skyscanner. To stretch your budget, consider hostels with shared dorms.

### Budget calculator

Use a simple budget calculator. List one-time expenses (airfare, transport) and daily expenses (stay, food, entertainment). Break down your total budget and allocate a percentage to each based on local rates. Free online travel budget calculators can split expenses with friends, track savings, and convert currencies.

### Airfare hacks

Book one-way tickets to mix airlines and pick the cheapest legs. Flying Monday–Wednesday is often cheaper than weekends. If you have multiple airports nearby, try the smaller ones. Book with a credit card to earn miles and deals. Unbooked seats sometimes get upgraded—ask with confidence.

## But most importantly…

When I first stepped out, I over-planned everything. Over time I realised it’s best not to get too caught up in the details once the basics are covered. Listen to your gut, ask for help when you need it, and if you run out of ideas, come back to this guide. You’re there to have fun—and that’s one detail you should never forget. Happy travels!
