“Travelling as a broke college student”, the idea may not be new to our friends living overseas, but for someone having grown up in an Indian middle-class family, it may as well be uncanny.

When I told my parents, as a 20 year old, not nearly fresh out of college, that I wanted to roam the streets of India, volunteer at hostels and meet new people, they only had one thing to say; ‘but what for?’. Concern for safety aside, the idea of wandering aimlessly, even for a little while does not sit well with brown parents. But as fresh young blood would have it, my mind was made up. As I packed my bags and left behind the comfort of home and two upset parents, I was a ball of nerves. But most of all, I was excited.

If, like me, travelling the world is also calling out to you but you don’t know where to begin, make this guide your best friend.


## Why travel solo?

If you are new to the world of travel, going off on a solo adventure can be intimidating. Planning, logistics and life’s plain unpredictability can definitely use some company. On the other hand, in my experience, going solo may open up many otherwise-missed opportunities.

When you travel alone, you get to live on your own schedule. Making impromptu plans is easier when you don’t have to account for another person. And you never know when you may need to change them on the go. With this flexibility you may also be able to make better use of your resources, especially when on a budget. Say, you’re the type of gal who just needs a clean bed and four walls to fall asleep. Stave off on that fancy stay and put your money towards trying out an adventure sport or exploring the local cuisine instead.

Aside from the place itself, it’s the people that add the most colour to any trip. An advantage of travelling alone is that it gives you a chance to mingle with new people, hear their stories and sometimes even make friendships that last a lifetime. All this and more can make travelling solo worth your while.

## What could go wrong?

It’s easy to get enchanted by the idea of being a nomad. But it’s not without its challenges. That’s why you’re better best prepared. Here are some things that you might want to consider before you set off on your travels.

### Money matters

When I first set off on my journey, as good as I felt about it, I had another thing coming. My new found freedom had come with a very empty pocket. Something I would become painfully aware of as time went by. And it may be true for some things that money can’t buy you happiness, it can afford you many essentials (and, some much need luxuries) during travel.

If you are on a budget, it is very important to spend some time anticipating and planning your expenditures. Some basics like food and transport are obvious contenders, but accounting for fun and leisure activities that you intend to do as well as emergency funds for unforeseen situations is always wise.

### Meeting new people

Almost everyone needs company. That stands true for solo travellers as well. Even if you are on a journey to “self-discovery”, meeting people adds to that reflection. Yet, introducing yourself to new people and connecting with them can be daunting, especially if everyone already seems to be paired off or in groups. Here, it is important to recite the mantra that I often use; “what’s there to lose?”.

What’s the worse that could happen if you put yourself out there? The most they could say is no. Then you try your luck again. But if you didn’t try you’d never know. So don’t hesitate to introduce yourself, or offer your plate of snacks or even chime into the discussion every once in a while and see where that takes you.

### Unforeseen roadblocks

Say you missed a bus, lost a bag or started to feel a flu coming on in a place where you barely know anyone- would you fall apart? It may feel like a world-ending disaster in that moment, but it can be easily managed if you are prepared for it. Having a back up plan, an emergency contact, and a trustee travel insurance can go a long way in exactly such situations.

But of course, it’s impossible and honestly a bit excessive to plan for everything that may or may not go wrong. At the end of the day, you’re there to have fun. In such instances it is best to take it as it goes and not panic. Remember, when one door closes…you know how it goes!

### Safety

Safety is probably the number one concern for solo travellers. And more so for women. It can discourage many from taking that route. While the concern for safety is valid, or rather essential, there are several ways to safeguard yourself. Picking the right stay, sharing your whereabouts with someone, and travelling in groups, especially during activities like hikes and treks can be a life saver- sometimes quite literally!

## How to work around it

The significance of being prepared cannot be overstated. Knowing where to start can be challenging. There are some simple and easy ways you can prepare against odds and make sure that you make the most of your experience.


### Planning and spontaneity

A good travel experience comes with an equal mix of careful planning and flexibility. Once you’ve landed on the destination, it’s time to plan your itinerary. Access to medical facilities and good connectivity can be some things to consider if you’re looking to stay somewhere for a longer duration.

Personally, I prefer looking up good cafes and hangs when deciding on a city to live in. It goes a long way, knowing what your options are, especially if you have any dietary or even budget restrictions. For smaller cities, cafes also tend to become regular haunts for travellers making it the perfect place to find company.

### Research the locality

If you are travelling abroad or even otherwise, it can be extremely helpful to accustom yourself to the local customs and traditions of the place. For example, there are some countries where people dress more modestly than the rest of the world. Knowing how to dress, eat, and behave so as to not come off rude or get in trouble can make your stay more pleasant and effortless.

### Getting the best deals

A seasoned traveller knows that extra cash will always come in handy on the road. That’s why shaving off on unnecessary expenses can be a big plus. Booking stays and flights at least 2–3 months in advance ensures that you get a better deal, especially if you are planning to visit during peak season. Turning on price alerts is another easy hack. If you aren’t travelling on a time constraint, you may consider doing it during the off season. It can make huge difference if you’re travelling to popular tourist destinations.

A common but extremely useful trick is to use comparison websites like Google Flights, Kayak, and Skyscanner that provide a single window view to different prices for the same service. To stretch your budget even further, consider rooming in a hostel with shared dorms.

### Budget calculator

Speaking of saving money, using a budget calculator can make a huge difference in ensuring that you don’t overspend. Start by listing all the possible expenditures you will make on your trip; both one-time (airfare, transport) and daily (stay, food, entertainment, ground travel). Keeping your overall budget in mind, break it down and allocate a percentage of the total to each element based on the going rates of your chosen destination.

You can also use free online travel budget calculators. All you have to do is fill in where you want to travel, what is your range of budget, and the currency you’ll be paying in, and it gives you how much can be expected to spend on each element in that country. Some of these apps can also be used to split expenses with friends, track your savings, convert your expenses into respective currencies, and more.

### Airfare hacks

Aside from booking in advance and turning on price alerts, there are a few lesser known airfare hacks you can use to lighten your spending. For instance, booking a one way ticket instead of a return flight allows you to choose from the cheapest flights even if they are from different airlines.

Consider rearranging your travel during weekdays. In fact, data shows that flying on a Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday is 13% cheaper than on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

If you have two or more airports near you, book flights out of the smaller or lesser travelled options as fares may be cheaper. You can also opt to book using a credit card to avail flyer miles and better deals. If you want to fly in comfort but don’t want to drain your life savings, you may even be able to get an upgrade for your economy seats at the airport that remain unbooked. But remember to ask with confidence!

## But most importantly…

When I first stepped out of the warm comforts of my home, I had a thousand things on my mind. I worried over the smallest possibilities and tried to come up with a game plan for everything. As time went by, I realised it’s best not to get too caught up in the details as long as you have the basics covered. Just listen to your gut, remember to ask for help whenever you need it, and if you ever run out of ideas, come back to this guide. At the end of the day, you’re there to have fun- and that’s one detail you should never forget. Happy travels!
