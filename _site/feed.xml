<p>I’m inspired from Richard Dawking and Charles Darwin <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">evolution</code> theory and believe we all are just the the advance organism evovled from very rudementary cells. We evolved on our own, there is no heavenly objective in this, just natural selection. That simplies things a lot.</p>

<h3 id="-what-is-our-purpose-of-life-">== What is our purpose of life ==</h3>

<p>There is no godly or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true purpose</code> of one’s life. As a part of humanity we might say our purpose is to reproduce and push the development of our species forward, but that applies to all living species.<br />
But since only humans are conscious of their present and upcoming future, we need some purpose to follow, and that comes from circumstances we live in. Like a person living in slum might have the purpose to have good flat in city. But these purposes are purely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">synthetic</code> and we’re free to have any one of them.</p>

<h3 id="-is-there-any-god-">== Is there any god ==</h3>

<p>I haven’t seen and never felt need of one. I think at the very start some smart people figured out most of the humans are <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weak</code> and have low <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">self confidence</code>. So they thought of ruling all of them, without making themselves as central figure. And that’s why they created religion.</p>

<h3 id="-root-problem-">== Root Problem ==</h3>

<p>I don’t think our root problem is lack of education or healthcare services. Our central problem is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">we</code> ourselves.

I already had trained model ready for deployment, only thing left was actual deployment. Front end was ready, only bottleneck was server - where to host the server <em>freely</em>. I can’t do it on localhost because my IP will change evertime I reconnect to internet and obviously I’m not going to rebuild the app each time IP is changed. So I needed a fixed public URL which I can use to build my app.</p>

<p>I know there are various options to host your server like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GCP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWS</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Digital Ocean</code>. But they all are paid and no matter how cheaper they are, still the same for me. So I tried hosting my model on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heroku</code>. See this <a href="https://ashukid.github.io/2018/12/16/deploy-models-on-heroku.html">blog</a> to know more about hosting on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heroku</code>. That didn’t work either becuase in short they give you only <em>500MB RAM</em> in free version, which is definitely not sufficient for running deep learning models.</p>

<p>After spending complete 2 days on Heroku I came to know that AWS gives free EC2 with <em>1GB of RAM for 1 year</em>. I was like - huh ! why don’t I spend my time on research !! So next I went for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWS</code>. I deployed my model on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AWS</code>, but it turned out even 1GB is not sufficient for my model (I was using Resnet50 model). Finally I sat down and tried to figure out what is the problem :</p>

<ol>
  <li>I can host on my localhost but can’t use the chaning IP address for building app.</li>
  <li>Cloud service do give fixed public URLs, but RAM is not sufficient.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the problem was - RAM and public URL. My localhost is solving the RAM problem, so I tried to figure out can I solve URL problem as well.</p>

<p>It turned out yes - <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is the solution. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrok</code> basically provides a tunnel from your local server endpoint to public endpoint. But again they don’t give you custom domain for free, everytime you run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrok</code> new public URL will be generated, so clearly can’t use it as well.
So then I searched for open source alternatives of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ngrok</code>.</p>

<p>Then I found <a href="https://serveo.net/">serveo</a>. And hell yeah, this was the solution of my problem. They provide custom domain freely and the better part no installation is required at all. I was really contended by their service and this was one of my findings that is gonna help me a lot in the future for sure.</p>

<p>Enough of background, let’s get directly to the steps for hosting your app :</p>

<h4 id="1-create-an-api-endpoint-for-your-app-"><strong>1. Create an API endpoint for your app :</strong></h4>

<p>First you need to create and API endpoint that you can use to call the server from your app. One of the easiest way to do that is to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flask</code>. Here is simple code to do that :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>app=Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/api',methods=['POST'])
def function(parameters):

    // do something
    // return result as json
    return jsonify(status='OK', results=answer)


if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=3000)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fire up terminal and executre - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python your_flask_app.py</code>. This will start hosting your API on localhost. You can check it on - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<h4 id="2-tunnel-localhost-to-public-url-"><strong>2. Tunnel Localhost to Public URL :</strong></h4>

<p>Fire up another terminal and write this command : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh -R your_subdomain:80:localhost:3000 serveo.net</code>.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your_domain</code> is the custom name you choose.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000</code> is your localhost endpoint (remember to change port 3000 in case you’re running the API on different port).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">80</code> is the http port</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">serveo.net</code> is the public domain.</li>
</ol>

<p>After executing this command, a url will be generated -<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your_subdomain.serveo.net</code>, which will be the public endpoint of your localhost, you can use it to build the app. Do remember serveo will generate this url only when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">your_subdomain</code> is available, so choose some creative name.</p>

<p>And that’s it. With this simple two step you can host your project locally. This is big aid for me as my local PC has enough RAM for deploying model and I don’t need APP for long term purposes.</p>]]></content><author><name>Swastika mukherjee</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog I'll explain you why hosting projects locally is a better option, how to start server on localhost and generate public url with custom domain name.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coding a Simple Logistic Regression in NumPy</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/19/logistic-regression-in-numpy.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coding a Simple Logistic Regression in NumPy" /><published>2018-12-19T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/12/19/logistic-regression-in-numpy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/19/logistic-regression-in-numpy.html"><![CDATA[<p>How many times I got stuck in understanding weight dimensions and dot products and thought I’ll code Simple Logistic regression in NumPy and go through the basics. But everytime my Laziness stopped me doing so. But not this time.</p>

<p>Logistic Regression is the one of the most fundamental concept of neural nets. In the 1950s decade there was huge interest among researchers to mimic human brain for artificial intelligence. At that time first Logistic Regression model was implemented with linear activation. It was trained with simple logistic loss function and worked well for linear data but failed substantially for non-linear one - like the very famous <strong>XOR</strong> gate problem.</p>

<p>Then in around 1980s came the concept of <strong>Gradient Descent</strong> and <strong>non-linear activation</strong>. This gained immense popularity at that time as the model started working for non linear data as well. Then came Backpropagation, ConvNets, RNNs which are now supported by immense computaion power and here we are with such explosion in Deep learning field. But it all started with <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>.</p>

<p>Logistic Regression is basically used for binary classification. It has two parts - <strong>forward pass</strong> and <strong>backward pass</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="1-forward-pass">1. Forward Pass:</h3>

<p>In the forward step you feed in multiple inputs, multiply it with corresponding weight vectors, add a bias vector and pass it through non-linear activation function (like <em>sigmoid</em>) and you’ll get a probability between (0 - 1). The mathematical equation for the same is given as :</p>

<p><code>out = sigmoid( w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + w(n)\*x(n) + b )</code></p>

<p><code>out = sigmoid( W<sup>T</sup>.X + b)</code></p>

<p>Here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> is input data and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out</code> is the network output. Let’s say we have a dataset <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(x,y)</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>(correct label) correspnds to label for corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and we get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out</code>(predicted label) from the network for the same x. Now we need to know how far is the predicted label from correct label. For that we define a loss function. In this case for keeping things simple let’s take mean square loss defined as :</p>

<p><code>L = 1/2(out-y)<sup>2</sup></code></p>

<h3 id="2-backward-pass">2. Backward Pass:</h3>

<p>In the backward step we need to alter weights so that model starts predicting better than the last time. We know how the model performed on the last iteration by loss function, we just need to somehow encode this information and pass it backwards. We do this by means of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gradient Descent</code>.
The loss function is parabolic as clear by the definition. So there exist a local minima for sure at which loss is minimum and model will perform the best. Gradients of any function tells the direction of steepest(maximum) increase. If we calculate the gradient of loss function and take negative of the value, that will give the direction of steepest decrease. But since gradients gives only direction, we multiply it by a constant <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(learning rate)</code> to get a value that signifies how far should we go in that direction. Add this value to the weights of the network to alter them so as to move one step further down the loss function. We do this recursively until we reach the local minima and that is precisely the <strong>Gradient Descent Algorithm</strong>.</p>

<p>For finding the gradient of loss function we take partail derivate of loss function with respect to weights of the network.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>∆L = (∂L(w1), ∂L(w2) ......), where ∂L(w1) = partial derivate of L with respect to w1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s differentiate loss with repect to w1 :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>∂L(w1) = (out-y)*out*(1-out)*x1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out*(1-out)</code> came because out is sigmoid activated function and derivative of sigmoid function is defined as :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>∂(sigmoid(x)) = sigmoid(x)*(1-sigmoid(x))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In general :</p>

<p><code>∂L(w<sub>i</sub>) = (out-y)_out_(1-out)\*x<sub>i</sub></code></p>

<p>So we alter weights as :</p>

<p><code>w<sub>i</sub> = w<sub>i</sub> - learning_rate \* ∂L(w<sub>i</sub>)</code></p>

<p>Now with this much theoretical background we can’t most surely code logistic regression and test on different data. Let’s make a simple network for AND gate.</p>

<h3 id="implementation"><strong>Implementation:</strong></h3>

<p>The dataset for <em>AND</em> gate is :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xdata=np.array([[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1]])
ydata=np.array([[0],[0],[0],[1]])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Defining helper functions :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def sigmoid(x):
    return 1/(1+np.exp(-x))

def sigmoid_derivative(x):
    return x*(1-x)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Defining hyperparameters (parameter not trained by model but specified manually) :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>input_neuron=2                      # number of inputs
output_neuron=1                     # number of outputs
etah=0.01                           # learning rate
batch_size=1                        # number of example we'll show the network at once
num_epoch=1000                      # how many times we'll loop over the data
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Define weights and biases:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>w=np.random.random(size=(input_neuron,))
b=np.random.random(size=(output_neuron,))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Main training code :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for epoch in range(num_epoch):
    for x,y in zip(xdata,ydata):

        out=sigmoid(x.dot(w)+b)                              # forward pass
        dw = (out-y)*sigmoid_derivative(out)                 # calculating derivative

        for i in range(len(w)):                              # backward pass(weights)
            w[i] = w[i] - etah*dw*x[i]
        for i in range(len(b)):                              # backward pass(bias)
            b[i] = b[i] - etah*dw
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After running this code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">num_epoch</code> times, the model will prefectly learn the weights.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>print(w,b)
=&gt; [2.64924114 2.6467143 ] [-4.09029157]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see when x1 and x2 both will be 1, then only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x1*w1+x2*w2</code> will be greater than bias and network will output 1 (hence AND gate).</p>

  <p>Spoiler : Heroku is not good enough for deploying deep learning models, so go for GCP, AWS or DigitalOcean. If you want to know why and don’t believe me until you do it yourself go ahead and read full content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was the first time I was deploying a model and creating a REST api endpoint to call from my mobile app or flask app. I already used all my digital ocean credit and didn’t want to use GCP or AWS. So i went for <strong>Heroku</strong>. I searched a lot whether we can deploy keras model on heroku or not, but didn’t get anything. So I went ahead and deployed my own model.</p>

<p>All the code snippets I use in this blog are on my <a href="https://github.com/ashukid/Deploy-keras-model-on-Heroku/tree/master">Github</a></p>

<h3 id="1-creating-the-rest-api-endpoint"><strong>1. Creating the REST Api endpoint</strong></h3>

<p>First let’s create a simple api endpoint and test it on local server. Go head and install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flask</code> first. Then create a file with name <em>main.py</em> and insert the following piece of code.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. app=Flask(__name__)
2. @app.route('/api',methods=['POST'])
3. def photoRecognize():

4.    im=request.form['image']
5.    im=unquote(im)
6.    answer=getFlowerClass(im)
7.    return jsonify(status='OK', results=answer)

if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=3000)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the 1st line I simply defined app name. In the 2nd line I created a route on which I’ll make post request (If these things are unclear go through flask basics and then come back and read next). In 3rd line I defined the function <em>(photoRecognize)</em> that will be called when we make request to the route. Inside the function I took the image (url encoded string, 4th line) that’ll be sent as POST request parameter. Then in 5th line url decoded the string and called the main function (<em>getFlowerClass</em>) which will process the image and send me the class the flower as string, which will be returned as JSON. If you want to have a look at the function (<em>getFlowerClass</em>) see my <a href="https://github.com/ashukid/Deploy-keras-model-on-Heroku/tree/master">Github</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="2-installing-heroku-cli"><strong>2. Installing Heroku CLI</strong></h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of command line, so I’ll be doing everything from command line itself. Go ahead and install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Heroku CLI</code>. Create a folder and put the file <em>main.py</em> inside it. Open up terminal and navigate to the folder just created and execute the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heroku create</code>. This creates a heroku app and and will print something like :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Creating app... done, ⬢ serene-caverns-82714

<p>First https link is the domain name of the app and second one is the link of github repository. A remote with name heroku is also created. So <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git init</code> the folder and add the remote :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/abc-xyz-12345.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="3-configurations-for-heroku-app"><strong>3. Configurations for Heroku App</strong></h3>

<p>Now is the time for adding configurations files for Heroku. Create following files in the same folder :</p>

<h4 id="a-runtimetxt-">A. runtime.txt :</h4>

<p>This file is used to specify the run time for the app and the specific version. In this case we’re using <em>python</em> runtime environment. So add this line in the file :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python-3.7.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="b-requirementstxt-">B. requirements.txt :</h4>

<p>Write down all the dependency of your app in this file like :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Flask==1.0.2
Keras==2.1.5
tensorflow==1.7.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Heroku will install all those dependencies at the time of deployment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE : If you need OpenCV for your app, it has some dependencies that needs to be installed with apt. For that follow step C.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="c-aptfile-">C. Aptfile :</h4>

<p>For all those dependencies that have to be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code>, first install herok-buildpack-apt with following command :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then create an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Aptfile</code> and write down all those dependencies like :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>libsm6
libxrender1
libfontconfig1
libice6
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These 4 dependencies are for OpenCV.</p>

<h4 id="d-procfile-">D. Procfile :</h4>

<p>This file tells Heroku what command to execute after app is deployed. In my case I wanted a web app, the file to run is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.py</code>, so my Procfile content was like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>web: gunicorn main:app --loga-file=-
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gunicorn is Python Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server. Go ahead and install it first.</p>

<h3 id="4-deploying-the-app"><strong>4. Deploying the App</strong></h3>

<p>Push all the codes to the repository.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git push heroku master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command will push all the codes, install all the requirements specified and release the 1st version of the app.
Go ahead and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heroku open</code> to run the app.</p>

<p>Since I was passing image as post request I had to use some app that can send post request to the endpoint. For that I used <em>Postman</em>.</p>

<p>Everything worked till I sent the post request. The app was deployed properly, all the requirements was installed and app was running all well locally. So I expected it to work from heroku server as well.
But as soon as I requested the server - boom !! App crashed.
I saw the logs (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">heroku logs --tail</code>), there I found sometimes <em>request timeour error</em> and sometimes <em>memory limit exceeded error</em>.</p>

<p>Here is the whole crush, heroku gives only <strong>30s</strong> for one request and a total of <strong>500MB</strong> of RAM. Both of them is insufficient for deep learning models as evaluation and processing takes more time as well as more memory .</p>

<p>Hence after a hard work of 2 days, I finally realised I’ve to buy credit on DigitalOcean or create account on GCP.</p>]]></content><author><name>Swastika mukherjee</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog is for all those enthusiast who wants to deploy there deep learning models freely on Heroku without the hassle of Google cloud platform or Amazon web services.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Next Generation Artificial Intelligence</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/01/next-generation-ai.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Next Generation Artificial Intelligence" /><published>2018-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-12-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/12/01/next-generation-ai</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/12/01/next-generation-ai.html"><![CDATA[<p>I was experimenting with different GAN models (Generative Adversarial Networks, if you don’t know) from a while and all the time I was feeling, this time I’m not teaching a machine how to do things, this time I’m asking a machine to be creative, like after showing some pictures asking it to generate similar pictures. (I’ll explain this in a while). It’s like telling a painter to paint something similar to landscape images, or telling a singer to sing similar to Ed Sheeran (off course we’ve to tell him first how landscape looks like or how Ed Sheeran voice sounds like). All this classification of cat and dog, stock prediction regression task, all that seems a decade ago work, even though it’s not. Now with the advancement in Reinforcement Learning and GAN we’ve come to next generation of AI.</p>

<p>So let’s dive deeper to understand GAN first. GAN is based on three concepts -</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"> <span class="no">Generative</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">Adversarial</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="no">Networks</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>So let’s begin with Network first.</p>

<p>Basically the network here means a <b>multilayer perceptron network</b> , though we use more advanced architecture, but for now let’s keep it simple. So there are two networks, Discriminator and Generator. Consider we’ve a cat image dataset (28 _ 28 ) and a function that generates uniform noise of given shape (let’s say 1 _ 100). So we give this uniform noise to the Generator and it’ll generate a 28 * 28 image from the noise. Let’s call it fake image (initially it’ll be just random noise). So we’ve real image from the cat dataset and fake image from the Generator, now we’ll challenge the Discriminator to tell which one is real image. Obviously in the start Discriminator will easily distinguish between both, but here is the nice concept. From the response of Discriminator, Generator network will alter its weights.You can think of it like Discriminator is telling you the probability of an image to be a real image. So initially it’ll be around 1 for real image and 0 for fake image. So we’ll take the difference and give it to the Generator, therefore the Generator will know how far it is from generating images like real ones and alter it’s weights accordingly.</p>

<p>Here comes the concept of Adversarial. Adversarial basically means a situation involving <b>opposition or conflicts</b>. If you look deeper you’ll see that’s exactly what happening. While Discriminator has to differentiate between real and fake image, Generator is trying to Generate images, that is similar to real image so that Discriminator can no more distinguish between them. That is Generator is just trying to fool the Discriminator while the Discriminator is trying not to get fooled (hence conflict). You can visualise the Generator as forger and Discriminator as Detective.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/gan1.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /></p>

<p>So once you train the two networks enough that the Discriminator is no more able to distinguish between real and fake image, giving probability of 0.5 for each image(optimal condition), that means Generator is generating as good image as the real one. But since the generated images comes from a random noise (that 1*100), no matter how much similar the image would be from the real one, it’ll be a unique image. Hence essentially the Generator is generating brand new images, and hence the word <b>Generative</b>.</p>

<p>So now we’ve a nicer concept of GAN, let me explain what I mean by Next Generation AI. If you see what have we done so far, you’ll notice we’ve just given senses to the machine. Like classifying images and localising the objects (eyes), classifying music (ears), in the robotics field you can push a robot and it’ll be not fall (touch) etc. Although we’re still lacking here with smell and taste.</p>

<p>Now with GAN we’re giving the machine <b>imaginative power</b>. It sounds like a sixth sense for a machine. We can let the machine see some images, and then we’re asking it to generate new unique images, to go in a imaginative world, create and carve new images, something very unique and very realistic as well. Although technically there is actually no imagination here, but looking from outside it does seem so.</p>

<p>With the advancement in GAN we can do hell lot of things, like you can generate new music (yes you can be a good composer with bad taste, although there are many in the industry), you can be a good painter without touching brushes. You might be thinking how is this different from copying, and here it is. While copying things we actually don’t think anything. We just join separate parts (like copying assignment from different friends). But with GAN we can create brand new things. Although all these is not possible yet, but if we can think of them, then we can definitely make it possible.</p>

<p>I would love to end my article by mentioning honourable comment from Yann LeCun (father of CNN if you don’t know) about GAN -</p>
