    <p>I’m entering the 4th Month of this year and it seems to me I spent last 3 recovering from different health issues.</p>

<p>First I got attacked with eye strain problem in January, and I had to limit laptop uses, which was a big challenge for me as I used to spend considerable amount of time with my laptop. So much that my sister used to call it my girlfriend !!</p>

<p>Then with throat infection and complete bedrest for almost a week in February. Then for a week everything was fine, but then again eye pain started.</p>

<p>This time it was more severe and instead of limiting laptop uses I had to stop using it altogether. For almost 2 weeks in March I didn’t use laptop. Then it was time for mid-semester break and I went to my home in the hope of 1 week complete break from any screens.</p>

<p>Till the end of week my plan was working fine, then suddenly I got attacked from all side - flu, cold, cough, chest pain, eye infection, throat infection and what not. I had to extend my vacation for almost a week in the hope of recovery.</p>

<p>Last saturday I came back to hostel and I almost recoverd from everything. 2 days went quite well, but again today I’m feeling chest pain and it’s around 1:00AM so can’t do anything other than pondering what have I lost in last 3 months because of my health issues.</p>

<p>There is also postitive side of all this. Because of eye pain I learnt how to spend my day without using laptop and yeah that is really funny, because earlier I used to believe I can’t possibly do that without getting bored. Because of other health issues I got to spend a lot time with my family. So yes it was fun, but then again I got what I didn’t expect, and still couldn’t get what I planned for this year.</p>

<p>Anyway there is nothing and no-one to complain for. What is done is done.</p>
