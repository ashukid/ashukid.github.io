I'm entering the 4th Month of this year and it seems to me I spent last 3 recovering from different health issues. 

First I got attacked with eye strain problem in January, and I had to limit laptop uses, which was a big challenge for me as I used to spend considerable amount of time with my laptop. So much that my sister used to call it my girlfriend !! 

Then with throat infection and complete bedrest for almost a week in February. Then for a week everything was fine, but then again eye pain started.

This time it was more severe and instead of limiting laptop uses I had to stop using it altogether. For almost 2 weeks in March I didn't use laptop. Then it was time for mid-semester break and I went to my home in the hope of 1 week complete break from any screens. 

Till the end of week my plan was working fine, then suddenly I got attacked from all side - flu, cold, cough, chest pain, eye infection, throat infection and what not. I had to extend my vacation for almost a week in the hope of recovery.

Last saturday I came back to hostel and I almost recoverd from everything. 2 days went quite well, but again today I'm feeling chest pain and it's around 1:00AM so can't do anything other than pondering what have I lost in last 3 months because of my health issues.

There is also postitive side of all this. Because of eye pain I learnt how to spend my day without using laptop and yeah that is really funny, because earlier I used to believe I can't possibly do that without getting bored. Because of other health issues I got to spend a lot time with my family. So yes it was fun, but then again I got what I didn't expect, and still couldn't get what I planned for this year. 

Anyway there is nothing and no-one to complain for. What is done is done.
