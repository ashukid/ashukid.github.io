Just sitting around and thinking stuff I stumbled on this beautiful (atleast to me) hypothesis. I called this - The Replication Hypothesis.

According to this hypothesis - "If we understand the fundamental structure and functioning of any object, only then we can replicate it".

The converse is also true - "If we don't understand the fundamental structure and functioning we can't replicate it". That makes sense and also gives the reason why we haven't replicated our brain yet.
