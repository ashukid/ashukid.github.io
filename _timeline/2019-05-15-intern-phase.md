Done with exams, now heading to Delhi for Summer Internship. I'm defining this as my summer phase with different set of goals.<br>
Many things are supposed to come after summer - placements, research intern, maybe startup, trips and I've to prepare myself for all those, that's all I've planned for this summer, but I'm all open for suprise experiences.
