Went to `pub` for the first time - started with beer then cocktail and ended with whisky peg. I feel I'm in full control now, but even if I'm not I wouldn't know this until tomorrow morning.<br>
The experience was very ok ok, mostly because I had very different expectations. All the images that I had for pubs and bars came from reading book by U.S. authors or watching U.S. series, so going to Indian pubs ain't gonna same for sure. I did know that but unfortunately I didn't train my mind to lower the expectation.<br>
Anyway almost 2 weeks of my intern are done. I spent these weeks mostly as social experiments - tried tinder and bumble, went to pubs and got drunk, went to social places to get socialised with new people, talked with friends more than I did ever before.<br>
But now I want to start working on `new project` from tomorrow onwards and make it as first priority and put this social experiment at lower priority.<br>
