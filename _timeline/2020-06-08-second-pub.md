Yo!! Went to pub for second time in a row. This time increased the intensity a bit. The ambience of the pub was pretty godd, way better than last time, drink was good save for the food. Food at the last pub was way way better than this one. 
This time I'am really feeling high and I know I'm writing this in that same state. Tomorrow mornig I might forget this but right now it's fun - life is fun !!
