<p>I'm a B.Tech(IT) Student at Indian Institute Of Information Techonology, Allahabad.</p>
<p>I'm a fan of arts and classic cult. I like ML and DL field because it has space for research and exploring new ideas. Hence I never feel I'm lacking art in my work.</p>
<p>I'm writing these blogs just for the sake of keeping a list of my explored areas so that I can look back anytime and revise concepts without much pain. So if anywhere between the blog you feel it's not worth reading, skip it without double thought. </p>
