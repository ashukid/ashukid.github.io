I’m Swastika Mukherjee, a content writer who enjoys turning rough ideas into clear, compelling stories. I help founders, marketers, and creators articulate their voice so audiences feel informed, not sold to.

My work spans blog articles, thought-leadership pieces, scripts, emails, and social copy. I start with research—talking to subject-matter experts, digging into user pain points, and mapping what really matters—then shape it into narratives that are concise, useful, and easy to trust.

I care about measurable impact: clean structure for skim readers, SEO that respects the reader, and visuals that support the story. If you want to collaborate or jam on content strategy, I’m always up for a chat.
