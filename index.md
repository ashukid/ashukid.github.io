title: About Me
---

<p>I'm Swastika Mukherjee, a content writer who turns rough ideas into clear, credible narratives. I work with founders, marketers, and creators to shape blog posts, thought-leadership pieces, scripts, and email/social copy that feel helpful—not salesy.</p>

<p>My process starts with research and empathy: talking to subject-matter experts, understanding audience pain points, and mapping the story so it’s easy to skim yet grounded in substance. I care about structure, clean language, and visuals that support the message.</p>

<p>I’m motivated by clarity and reader trust—strong intros, logical flow, and concrete takeaways that respect people’s time. When a piece feels effortless to read and actually helps someone, that’s the win.</p>
