<p>Hi, I’m Swastika. Welcome to my blog.</p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts, some half-baked, some deeply felt, all very mine. This blog is dedicated to everything I love, live, and breathe; ergo- travel, everyday life, and the strange comfort of putting feelings to words. If you’re looking for honest stories and messy in-betweens, follow me along and let’s have some fun.</p>
